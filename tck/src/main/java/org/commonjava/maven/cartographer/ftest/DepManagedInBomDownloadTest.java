/**
 * TCK test class checking that an imported BOM with another BOM imported in a project are included when running
 * generateƒçPOM() method. The dependency graph looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *   +----------+             imports             +-------+
 *   | consumer |-------------------------------->|  bom  |
 *   +----------+                                 +-------+
 *        |                                           |
 *        | depends on with no version specified      | manages dep version to 1.1
 *        V                                           |
 *   +---------+                                      |
 *   |   dep   |<-------------------------------------+
 *   +---------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code consumer} is used as the request root artifact. Used preset is "requires", which results in usage of
 * {@link ScopeWithEmbeddedProjectsFilter} with scope runtime, i.e. runtime dependency graph. Consumer pom, bom pom
 * and dep jar 1.2 are expected to be in the result.
