/**
 * TCK test class checking that a parent of an imported BOM in a project is included when running generateƒçPOM() method.
 * The dependency graph looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *   +----------+
 *   | consumer |
 *   +----------+
 *        |
 *        | imports
 *        V
 *   +---------+
 *   |   bom   |
 *   +---------+
 *        |
 *        | has parent
 *        V
 *    +--------+
 *    | parent |
 *    +--------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code consumer} is used as the request root artifact. Used preset is "requires", which results in usage of
 * {@link ScopeWithEmbeddedProjectsFilter} with scope runtime, i.e. runtime dependency graph. Consumer pom, bom pom
 * and parent pom are expected to be in the result.
