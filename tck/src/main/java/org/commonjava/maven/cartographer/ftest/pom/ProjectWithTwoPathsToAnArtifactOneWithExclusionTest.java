/**
 * TCK test class checking that a parent of a transitive dependency accessible through 2 paths, one of them with
 * declared exclusion of the transitive dependency in dependency management, is included when running generateƒçPOM()
 * method. The dependency graph looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *   +----------+
 *   | consumer |
 *   +----------+
 *        |
 *        | depends on
 *        V
 *   +---------+ dapMgmt specifies transitive-dep with exclusion of excluded-dep
 *   |   dep   |-----------------------+
 *   +---------+                       | depends on
 *        |                            V
 *        |                      +-----------+
 *        | depends on           |   dep2    |
 *        |                      +-----------+
 *        V                            |
 * +----------------+                  | depends on
 * | transitive-dep |<-----------------+
 * +----------------+
 *        |
 *        | depends on
 *        V
 *  +--------------+
 *  | excluded-dep |
 *  +--------------+
 *        |
 *        | has parent
 *        V
 *   +----------+
 *   |  parent  |
 *   +----------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code consumer} is used as the request root artifact. Used preset is "requires", which results in usage of
 * {@link ScopeWithEmbeddedProjectsFilter} with scope runtime, i.e. runtime dependency graph. Consumer pom, jars of dep,
 * dep2, dep3 and dep4 and parent pom are expected to be in the result.
 *
 * The motivation for this test was an artifact embedding EAP assembly. The assembly specified dependency management of
 * jbossxts with exclusion of arjunacore. The problem is when the EAP assembly is not the root artifact, the dependency
 * management got used only for the direct path while jbossxts is referenced also transitively through jboss-as-xts and
 * jbosstxbridge, for which the exclusion is not specified. The graph aggregator marked the jbossxts as seen while it
 * didn't store arjunacore's relationships, because the rel was not accepted. So as the result arjunacore-all, which is
 * arjunacore's parent was missing in the result, but arjunacore itself was included, which was correct.
