/**
 * TCK test class checking that a simple test-scoped dependency of a project is included when running generateƒçPOM()
 * method. The dependency graph looks like this:
 * <pre>
 *   +----------+
 *   | consumer |
 *   +----------+
 *        |
 *        | depends on (test scope)
 *        V
 *   +----------+
 *   |   dep    |
 *   +----------+
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code consumer} is used as the request root artifact. Used preset is "build-requires", which results in usage of
 * {@link org.commonjava.cartographer.graph.preset.BuildRequirementProjectsFilter}, i.e. build-time dependency graph.
 * Consumer pom and dep jar are expected to be in the result.
